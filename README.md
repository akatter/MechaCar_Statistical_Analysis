# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis - Module 15 - R and Stats

## Overview of Analysis

The purpose of this project is to complete a series of statistical analysis for the analysis of a MechaCar process. The four tasks will be completed using R.


## Resources Used

- Software: RStudio 2022.02.1 Build 461

## Analysis and Results

The four tasks to be completed are as follows:

- Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
- T-Test on Suspension Coils
- Designing a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Based on the results shown:
- The variables of vehicle_length and ground_clearance have the the most significance to the mpg values
- Based on the p-value of 5.35e-11, less then an assumed significance of 0.05, the slope can be assumed to not be zero
- Based on the Multiple R-squared value of 0.7149, a decent amount of the mpg performance can be estimated by the model, but the high significance of the intercept may indicate transformations or other variables may need to be researched.
